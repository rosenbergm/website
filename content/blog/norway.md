in summer of 2022, i went to oslo, norway. i've never traveled to a nordic country before and i was told that it is beautiful there. so i checked it out.

i wrote these memories down in the moment i experiencing them.

## day 1

### norwegian really is the "best low-cost european airline"

when i went through the gate into the airplane (yes, they have boarding bridges, unlike ryanair with their buses), i received a warm welcome by the two flight attendants. both of them were really nice and friendly throughout the whole flight. one of them looked very czech, the other one very norwegian — an ideal pair for a prague-oslo flight.

### the best bottle to buy home

upon seating myself, i notice a norwegian pair with a sealed bag from the duty-free zone containing two bottles of, what they thought was, the best czech spirit one can buy. sadly, they didn't know that what they had in their bag was the worst alcohol of czech origin money can buy.

### keep your legs out of my seat!

my seat was an isle seat, just as i like sitting. the two other seats were occupied by a couple. while the woman was sleeping in the window seat, the man (sitting next to me) constantly manspreaded all over my seat. i know, the leg space is small (not as small as on ryanair though) and the seat is uncomfortable but i want to get some sleep and that goal cannot be achieved with a fourth of my seat occupied by a leg that is not mine.

### the train

oslo, unlike prague, has a train connection between its airport and the city. and it is so fucking fast. you can get from oslo airport to the city center in 17 minutes, traveling 40 kilometers at a speed od 120 kilometers per hour. that is what i call a fast train.

### oslo city center is like tetris

the oslo city center looks... weird. it is very dense and packed with large, architectonically beautiful buildings. everything is close by but at the same time it is fairly filthy. the central station is not as bad as in prague but it is definitely not the nicest place in oslo as well.

### light-speed trams

maybe it's just the fact that oslo is not that big of a city, but the trams are lightning fast. and they are big as fuck, much bigger than the ones in prague.

### trikk

that’s how you say tram in norwegian. it's so cute.

### the t-bane

oslo has subway and i really want to take a ride.

### thor’s apartment

once i checked into my apartment i found on airbnb, i was amazed. the apartment looked very small in the app but in reality, it was so spatious and just felt norwegian. it is situated in the more hipster part of oslo called grunerlokka, which is filled with cute cafes and bars.

### a hotdog

my friend recommended me to get a hotdog in this very small and sketchy-looking stand. so i did. hope there will be no food poisoning.

### a park

along the river akerselva that runs through the city, there is a riverside park with bike-paths and amazingly green grass to sit on.

### the architecture

literally every house and building in the city is so beautiful. the opera, which is just next to the port and the shore, is so magnificent.

## day 2

### 22 degrees celsius

it's not that hot outside. no clouds in the sky, just the glowing white dot we call sun. and the people of oslo decided it's the best time to sunbathe. typical norway?

### a hotdog, pt. 2

i didn't get food poisoning from the hotdog. thank god.

### fountains

the fountains in all the parks were turned off just to save water. smart move, oslo city!

### grass

the grass is very green in all the parks. how to they do that?

### the buses

nearly all the buses are electric and they are super comfortable. duh, all public transport in oslo is.

### the metro

even though oslo is not that big of a city, it has a subway system. and the trains are so fucking long. why?

### barbershops

on the block i lived were four barbershops. who needs four barbershops in one block?

### 22 degrees celsius, pt. 2

it's 7 pm, and the norwegians are still sunbathing.

### haircuts

it seems to me that all the people here have the same haircut. like literally everybody. yeah, the clothes are different (they really know how to dress) but the hair is identical on every single person.

### aker brygge

aker brygge is a modern office district on the coast. it feels like a city in a city.

## day 3

### the ac

it's 16 degrees outside and the buses have the ac turned on to full power. why?

### last coffee

the coffee situation in oslo is still under development but there are so many nice places here. you just have to look for them.
